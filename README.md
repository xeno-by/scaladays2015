### obey demo

Hosts demos prepared for a ScalaDays talk (17 Mar 2015) and a Scala Bay meetup (19 Mar 2015).

This demo has become possible thanks to the work of Adrien Ghosn during his semester project at EPFL: [Obey: Code Health for Scala.Meta](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/204804). Special thanks to Mathieu Demarne who patched Obey and prepared an example project for ScalaDays!

In order to play with the demo, a patched version of Obey is required, which is available at [https://github.com/scalameta/Obey/tree/scaladays2015](https://github.com/scalameta/Obey/tree/scaladays2015). After cloning the repository, run `sbt publishLocal`, and you're good to go.
